# audioKNN-Classifier
This project classifies audio features in the time and frequency domains using MATLAB. Audio features are extracted and classified via the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, with dimensionality reduction performed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for simplified 3D visualization and minimized information loss.
# Dataset
The dataset includes three classes of sounds (cow, clapping, engine) from the ESC-50 environmental sound classification dataset, representing animal, human (non-vocal), and urban sounds. Each class is split 70/30 for training and testing.
